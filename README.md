#First task: processArray Operation
Goal: Create the processArray function, which manipulates an array of integers. In particular:


The function should square each even integer that is present in the array.
In the array, the function should triple each odd number.
These updated values are returned in a new array by the method.
#second task:arraystring formatting Operation
The goal is to improve the arrayManipulation.js file by include the formatArrayStrings method. This feature:

accepts two input arrays, one of which should contain numbers and the other of strings and should be the output of the processArray function.
alters every string in the string array according to the number that corresponds to it in the numbers array:
The method should uppercase the entire string if the integer is even.
The function should change the entire text to lowercase if the number is odd.
yields a new array with the altered strings.
#Third task: build user profiles Operation
Goal:
Make a different file called userInfo.js with the method createUserProfiles in it. This feature:


accepts two input arrays as input: one with the original names and the other with the changed names (formatArrayStrings function result).
creates an array of objects with three attributes for each object:
originalName: the first array's original name.
modifiedName: the second array's changed name.
id: an automatically-incremented number that begins at 1.
gives back this array of objects, so giving each name a profile.
